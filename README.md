# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created as a start to my journey through field of web development. I was motivated to create this project to expose myself to the many aspects of web development projects including, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and the challanges of incorporathing them together in a real world scenario. The problem was I did not have a good understanding of how to use Github repositories and its features, a necessary and useful process for the start of my journey. This project allowed me to gain a better understanding of git-commit and git pull process as well as creating pull requests and merging branches. I think this project will continue to be very valueable in the future as I look back on how far I've come.
